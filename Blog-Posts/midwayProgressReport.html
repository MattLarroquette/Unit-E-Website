          <h3 class="mid-title">Features Implemented</h3>
          <p class="blog-writeup">One of the biggest features that we implemented for the midterm demo is our characters (heroes as we like to call them). We set out to have three different classes of heroes: a knight, ranger, and mage, each with their own unique attacks and movement speeds. The first thing we did for our heroes was draw them out on paper. Simonne did an excellent job capturing what we thought each hero was supposed to look like. After they were sketched out and agreed upon, Brandon started working on transforming them from drawing to pixel art. He created all of the character’s pixel art design from standing still, moving in all directions, and their basic attack animations. After we had the characters looking like we wanted it was time to start giving them some functionality.</p>
          <p class="blog-writeup">First we implemented the hero movement, the knight being the slowest and the ranger being the fastest. To accomplish this, each hero was given a common script for movement. The script moves the player in the direction of a vector created from the horizontal and vertical input axis, and sends messages to each hero’s animator to update the animation. Additionally the script was given a public float variable for base movement speed, which we modified on each individual hero. The ranger’s speed was set to 3.5, the mage’s speed was set to 2.75, and the knight’s speed was set to 2. Once that was done, we set our heroes up to be controllable by either a keyboard or a controller. This includes moving and attacking. In our midterm demo, all heroes are playable.</p>
          <p class="blog-writeup">In addition to the three heroes, we also implemented the basic fodder enemies. Fodder enemies are characterized by being slow and having little health, but appearing in large numbers to overwhelm the player. To implement the fodder enemy, we created a script which had two states: wander and attack. We used raycasts to determine the state the fodder enemy should be in. When the fodder enemy is in a wander state, it selects a random direction to move in every two seconds. If the monster can draw an unblocked raycast between itself and the player, however, it enters the attack state. </p>
          <p>During the attack state, the fodder enemy moves towards the player. If the raycast to the player becomes blocked by a solid object, it goes back to the wander state. We then created gameobjects with a special script that creates a new fodder enemy every 10 seconds and placed them around a simple game map, to demonstrate how the fodder enemies would continually swarm the player. When the fodder enemy comes into contact with a damaging object such as a fireball, an arrow, or the knight’s sword, its health points are reduced by one and it spends a short time blinking with its collider disabled. When its health points reach zero, after it is done blinking it is destroyed in a puff of smoke. </p>
          <p class="blog-writeup">We have also done the work of compiling several sound effects for our game. We have a sword slash sound, a sound for throwing a fireball, a sound for an arrow moving through the air, and background music for the game itself. Most of these sounds were pulled off freesound.org. While we were searching for effects we wanted each one to be easy on the ears and minimal in terms of loudness, sharpness, to minimize player annoyance. If we couldn’t get through one five second sound effect, there was no way the player was going to be able to listen to it over and over. We want the game to be up-tempo and fast paced so for our background music we wanted that to reflect the tempo of the game. </p>
          <p class="blog-writeup">Finally, we have created a working prototype for the character select screen, although it is not integrated into the demo. It consists of 3 placeholder “pedestals” which, in the final version, will display each of the three heroes. In the current prototype, one can use the input axis to scroll through each of the heroes. Each pedestal, when selected, will display descriptive information about the hero’s health points, attacks, and special abilities.</p>
          <h3 class="mid-title">Future Plans</h3>
          <p class="blog-writeup">While we got a lot done for the midterm demo, we still have a long way to go. For starters we need to implement our health system. Currently, our heroes can’t die, reaching a failstate. The plan for the health system is that each hero has different maximum health. Our knight hero will have the most health with four total hearts, our mage will be the most balanced hero with three hearts, and finally the ranger will be the least durable with two hearts. The health differences are meant to encourage unique playstyles for each class. With the health system, when each character is hit they will blink, showing that they got hit, and will temporary be immune to all incoming attacks for a short period of time. The idea behind that feature is to give the user a chance to regroup after being hit, and prevent situations where they feel like they are unfairly trapped.</p>
          <p class="blog-writeup">A big feature that is missing from the demo is the presence of the other four enemy types. Currently, we only have our basic enemy implemented, the fodder enemy. Our plan is to give the player five different enemy types to battle against: the “fodder enemies” which attack the player character in large hordes, but are destroyed easily and do little damage, the “warrior enemies,” which are less common than fodder enemies but take more hits and employ more complex tactics, the “brute enemies” which have large amounts of health and special attacks, the “support enemies” that have special moves which can heal or revive other enemies, and finally the boss enemy which, as expected, is the most difficult of all the enemy types to defeat. Along with getting each enemy type down, we also plan on implementing endless spawning for each enemy. We want to have a max number of each enemy types on screen at all times, so whenever a type of enemy is defeated we want to be able to spawn another of that type. The goal is to defeat the boss, but we want to make our enemies a tough roadblock. Our initial plans for the boss enemy was to have it on the map at all times to maximize the player’s opportunity to attack. Now, though, we are thinking that our boss is going to be some type of dragon. With our dragon boss, we are thinking that it will be able to fly off the screen at some points and then come crash back onto the level, perhaps creating some type of shockwave. Enemy types (all of them except the boss) must also randomly drop items when defeated. We have three drops in mind, armor, bombs, and health potions. Armor drops will be the most common, dropped by weaker enemies, while health potions and bombs will be less common, dropped by tougher enemies. </p>
          <p class="blog-writeup">Armor will give the player protection against attacks and will be denoted by a metal shield over the player’s hearts. The armor will act as a second health bar on top of the player’s hearts, and can protect against, at most, as many hits as the player has hearts. The second drop would be a bomb. The bomb would be a throwable or placeable object that does damage to any enemies in its blast radius. Finally we have a health potion which when drank, will fill up one of the player’s missing hearts.</p>
          <p class="blog-writeup">In our design document we discussed an inventory or item system. Essentially the inventory system will allow the player to be able to cycle between the items that the player picks up during battle. There is a catch with the inventory system though, it only has space for five items. That means you can only pick up and save five items at a time, so if you pick up five bombs you won’t be able to pick up any other item until you free up space in your inventory by using one of the bombs you have. Notice that if you pickup an item, you have to use it at some point. The player wont be able to just drop an item to make space for another one, you have to actually put the item into play to free up an inventory slot.</p>
          <p class="blog-writeup">Another thing that we need to do is revamp our level design. We want the level to have different obstacles the player will encounter, good looking art, and possibly different sounds. Currently our obstacles are only different shapes with varying different sizes. In the midterm demo our level does not look great so that’s something we are going to definitely need to redesign.</p>
